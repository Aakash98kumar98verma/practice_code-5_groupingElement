          <p>A <span style="color: red;">son and his father </span>were walking on the mountains. Suddenly, his son falls, hurts himself and screams. To
               his surprise, <span style="color: red;">he hears the voice repeating, somewhere in the mountain.</span> Curious, he yells: ‘‘Who are you?"
               He receives the answer: <span style="color: red;">“Who are you?" </span>And then he screams to the mountain: “I admire you!" The voice
               answers: <span style="color: red;">"I admire you!"</span> Angered at the response, he screams: “Coward!" He receives the answer: “Coward!"
               He looks to his father and asks: “What’s going on?" The father smiles and says: “My son, pay attention."
               Again the man screams: “You are a champion!" The voice answers: <span style="color: red;">“You are a champion!"</span> The boy is
               surprised, but does not understand. Then the father explains: <span style="color: red;">“People call this ECHO. But really this is LIFE."</span> It gives you back everything you say or do. Our life is simply a reflection of our actions. If you
               want more love in the world, create more love in your heart. If you want more competence in your team,
               improve your competence. This relationship applies to everything, in all aspects of life. Life will give
               you back everything you have given to it.</p>
          <p>The moral of the story is that <span style="color: red;">Your life is not a coincidence. It’s a reflection
                    of you!</span></p>
